"""The wire contract for a served tracegym environment.

This module is the *only* thing a client needs to agree with. It is pure
pydantic and has no imports from the runtime, so a trainer can vendor it,
generate types from it, or reimplement it in another language without pulling
in SQLite or the reconstruction pipeline.

=========================  ======================================  =========================
Method / path              Request body                            Response body
=========================  ======================================  =========================
``GET  /health``           --                                      :class:`HealthResponse`
``GET  /spec``             -- (optional ``?task_id=``)              :class:`EnvSpec`
``POST /reset``            :class:`ResetRequest`                   :class:`ResetResponse`
``POST /step``             :class:`StepRequest`                    :class:`StepResponse`
``POST /close``            :class:`CloseRequest`                   :class:`CloseResponse`
=========================  ======================================  =========================

Every non-2xx response is an :class:`ErrorResponse` -- structured JSON with a
machine-readable :class:`ErrorCode`, never an HTML traceback. A trainer that
loses a rollout needs to know *which* failure it was (episode gone? cap hit?
tool unsupported?) without scraping a stack trace.

Episode model
-------------

``/reset`` mints a fresh ``episode_id`` backed by its own materialized
environment session. ``/step`` routes by ``episode_id`` and touches nothing
else; there is no implicit "current episode" anywhere in this protocol, because
an implicit current episode is exactly how parallel rollouts corrupt each
other. ``/close`` tears the session down. See :mod:`tracegym.serve.server`.

Versioning
----------

:data:`PROTOCOL_VERSION` is bumped on any change a client could notice. It is
returned by ``/health`` and ``/spec``; a client should refuse a server whose
major version differs from its own.
