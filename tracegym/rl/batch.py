"""``TaskSuite`` -- many tasks, one training distribution, with the review gate.

A trainer does not want one environment, it wants a distribution to sample from.
:class:`TaskSuite` is that distribution: a set of ``(task, verifier)`` pairs over
a shared schema and action space, sampled by seed, filterable by outcome label
and by review status.

The gate
--------
**A task whose verifier has ``reviewed_by=None`` is excluded from the suite by
default.** PLAN.md Step 11 says a generated reward function must be read by a
person before it grades anything, and this is the boundary where that rule
actually bites: :func:`tracegym.verify.run.evaluate` can refuse a single call,
but training is where an unexamined reward function does its damage, silently,
across millions of steps.

Excluded tasks are never dropped quietly (BUILD_PLAN rule 6). They land in
:attr:`TaskSuite.excluded` with a reason, so an operator can see that their
suite of 40 tasks is training on 6 and why.

``allow_unreviewed=True`` opts back in, explicitly, in the caller's own code --
which is the point: the decision is visible at the call site instead of buried
in a default.
