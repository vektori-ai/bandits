"""Load the declared tool registry.

Why the registry matters (PLAN.md Step 6): the traces tell you what the agent
*did*, the registry tells you what it *could have done*. Traces alone give an
environment with holes exactly where production is thin. So the registry is a
first-class input, not a nicety -- it is where ``ToolProfile.declared_schema`` and
``declared_only`` (the probing candidates) come from.

Input shape is the one in ``tests/fixtures/tools.json``: a JSON array of
``{"name", "description", "input_schema"}`` objects.
