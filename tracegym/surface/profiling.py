"""Argument and response profiling.

Turns a set of observed JSON payloads for one tool into `FieldProfile`s.

What a profile buys us (PLAN.md, "The key concept: invocation points"): the
declared schema tells you what a tool *accepts*; the profile tells you what the
production agent actually *sent*. That gap is the "5 of 38 parameters are ever
used" signal, and it is what keeps a generated environment from having to model
33 parameters nobody ever touches.

Nesting rules
-------------
Objects are flattened to dotted paths: ``{"order": {"customer_id": 88}}`` becomes
``order.customer_id``. Arrays get a ``[]`` suffix: ``order_ids`` is profiled as
an ``array`` field (one occurrence per payload) *and* its elements are profiled
under ``order_ids[]`` (one occurrence per element). Arrays of objects therefore
produce ``items[].sku`` and friends, which is what stage 3 needs to spot
identifiers that only ever appear inside a list.

Everything here is deterministic: no sampling, no dict-ordering dependence.
Sample values are sorted by ``(json type, canonical json)`` and capped.

    2. **Recurrence rule.** The field holds scalars, we saw it at least
       ``3`` times, at least ``60%`` of those values were distinct, and at least
       one of those values also appears as an *argument value of a different
       tool*. That last clause is the real signal: an id is a value that travels
       between tools. A free-text ``subject`` never does; ``7741`` does, because
       it comes out of ``search_orders`` and goes into ``refund_order``.

    Failure modes, stated plainly:

    * The name rule fires on anything called ``valid_id`` or ``request_id`` even
      when no entity is behind it. Downstream (stage 3) must confirm with real
      recurrence before creating a table.
    * The recurrence rule misses identifiers that only one tool ever touches --
      an id used in exactly one place is indistinguishable from a parameter.
    * Low-cardinality enums shared across tools (``status="delivered"``) are
      rejected by the distinct-ratio clause, but a *high*-cardinality shared
      free-text field (an email address passed to two tools) will be called an
      identifier. That is arguably correct: it is functioning as a key.
