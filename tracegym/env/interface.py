"""The environment session contract.

This file is the published boundary between a materialized environment and
everything that drives one: stage 6 (fidelity replay), the RL rollout loop, and
stage 5's verifiers. It is deliberately tiny. Four methods plus a lifecycle.

    with session:
        obs = session.execute("get_order", {"order_id": 7741})
        rows = session.snapshot()
        fx = session.effects()
        man = session.manifest()

The boundary rule
-----------------
**Every state change must go through :meth:`EnvSession.execute`.**

``snapshot()`` returns a *copy* of the store, never a live handle, and there is
no public setter. A rollout that reaches around ``execute()`` -- opening the
SQLite file directly, mutating the returned snapshot dicts and expecting it to
stick, or appending to the ledger by hand -- is **reward hacking**: it produces
the final state a verifier asserts on without performing the actions that were
supposed to produce it. Stage 5's anti-cheat depends on exactly this boundary,
and the only way it can depend on it is if the boundary is real. So:

* the store connection is private to the session,
* the ledger is append-only through the session and frozen at close,
* ``effects()`` and ``snapshot()`` hand back immutable / detached data.

Failure discipline
------------------
A tool the environment cannot faithfully reimplement raises
:class:`UnsupportedToolError`. It never returns a success-shaped
:class:`~tracegym.contracts.Observation`. Faking success here would silently
corrupt every downstream reward: the agent would be trained to call a tool that
does nothing and be paid for it. An *observed* failure (a missing row, a
conflicting write) is different -- that is real environment dynamics and comes
back as ``Observation(status=ERROR, error_kind=...)``.
