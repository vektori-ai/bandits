"""Infer the tables behind the tools.

This is the core of stage 3 and the hardest step in PLAN.md (Step 7). The input
is a stream of ``(tool, arguments, response)``. The output is a set of
:class:`~tracegym.contracts.EntitySchema` objects that make that stream
consistent.

The chain of reasoning, each link of which is a documented rule below:

1. **Anchor.** A response body describes a row, and the row is identified by
   the identifier the caller passed in and the response echoed back
   (:func:`choose_anchor`). ``get_order(order_id=7741)`` -> body echoing
   ``order_id: 7741`` means "this body is the row ``orders#7741``".
2. **Group.** All bodies with the same anchor field are the same table
   (:func:`group_observations`).
3. **Name.** The table is named by pluralizing the anchor's stem, with the
   noun taken from the tools when the anchor carries no stem (:func:`entity_name`).
4. **Fields.** The columns are the *union* of every field any response ever
   showed, because different tools project different subsets
   (:func:`build_field_profiles`).
5. **Reads and writes.** From the :class:`~tracegym.contracts.ToolSurface` when
   we have one; from observed body changes when we do not (:func:`infer_writers`).
6. **Degrade honestly.** A body with no identifier at all is not forced into a
   table; it becomes a static snapshot or is left unresolved
   (:func:`snapshot_drafts`).

    3. the tool is argument-deterministic: identical arguments always produced
       identical bodies. Otherwise the response depends on something we cannot
       see, and pinning a snapshot would make the rebuilt environment lie.

    **Evidence required.** One observation. A single verbatim row is honest;
    the dishonest move would be generalizing it into a schema.

    **When evidence is insufficient.** The tool's name is returned in the second
    element, destined for ``StateSchema.unresolved``.
