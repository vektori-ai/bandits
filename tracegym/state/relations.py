observed value sets and ask whether one is drawn from another - with a name

    **Rule FK-1 (name-corroborated).** Field ``f`` of entity ``A`` references
    ``B`` when ``f`` has the same name as ``B``'s primary key, ``f`` is not
    ``A``'s own primary key, and at least one of ``f``'s observed values was
    actually seen as a key of ``B``. Requires
    :data:`MIN_FK_OBSERVATIONS` observations of ``f``.

    Full containment is deliberately *not* required here. ``orders.sku`` takes
    four values in the golden corpus while ``get_product`` was only ever called
    for two of them: the unseen skus are rows we never observed, not evidence
    against the relationship. Partial coverage is recorded honestly by lowering
    ``confidence`` instead of dropping the key.

    **Rule FK-2 (value-only).** With no name match, we require much more: every
    distinct value of ``f`` must be a known key of ``B``, over at least
    :data:`MIN_FK_DISTINCT_VALUE_ONLY` distinct values and
    :data:`MIN_FK_OBSERVATIONS_VALUE_ONLY` observations, and the resulting
    confidence is capped at :data:`VALUE_ONLY_CONFIDENCE_CEILING`. Small integer
    columns land inside each other's ranges by accident constantly; this rule
    exists to catch a renamed key (``buyer`` -> ``customers.customer_id``), not
    to trawl.

    **When evidence is insufficient.** No ``ForeignKey`` is emitted. A missing
    foreign key costs a downstream join; an invented one corrupts the rebuilt
    database and every verifier written against it. The returned
    :class:`FKEvidence` list records what was considered either way.

    Static snapshots (no primary key) are never a target: we do not claim to
    know what their rows are keyed by. Self-references are skipped - the
    corpus cannot distinguish a genuine self-reference from a row echoing its
    own key.
