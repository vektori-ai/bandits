"""Infer *what* a write tool writes, not merely *that* it writes.

:func:`tracegym.state.entities.infer_writers` and
:func:`~tracegym.state.entities.split_by_surface` answer "does this tool mutate
the entity?" and stop there. The evidence they consult - the before/after
windows around a call, inside one trace, on one row - also carries the *content*
of the write, and this module keeps it instead of throwing it away.

Why it matters: without this, the only thing downstream has left is the tool's
English name, and ``refund_order -> status="refunded"`` is a verb-tense pun that
breaks the first time it meets ``approve_return -> "authorized"`` or a localized
tool name. Everything below is derived from observed values.

The chain of reasoning, one documented rule per step:

1. **Window.** For each successful write, reconstruct the row as it was
   *before* (:func:`_pre_state`) and as it was *after* (:func:`_post_state`).
2. **Diff.** The columns that differ, or that appear for the first time, are
   what the call changed (:func:`_changed_columns`).
3. **Key.** The argument whose value is the row's key names the row
   (:func:`_infer_key_argument`).
4. **Arguments -> columns.** An argument whose *value* turns up in a changed
   column is the source of that column (:func:`_infer_argument_columns`).
5. **Constants.** A changed column that took the same value on every single
   successful call, and that no argument supplied, is a constant the tool sets
   (:func:`_infer_constants`).
6. **Echoes.** The columns the write's own response body hands back
   (:func:`_response_echoes`).

**Only ``CallStatus.OK`` calls are evidence.** An errored ``refund_order``
changed nothing, and its ``{"error": "already_refunded", "order_id": 7741}``
body would otherwise donate a bogus ``error`` column and a phantom diff. Error
calls never reach this module: they are already filtered out of
:class:`~tracegym.state.entities.Observation` by
:func:`~tracegym.state.entities.group_observations`.

**When evidence is absent.** A tool that ``written_by`` names but that produced
no attributable successful response still gets a
:class:`~tracegym.contracts.WriteEffect`, with ``evidence_count == 0``,
``confidence == 0.0``, empty inferences and an ``evidence`` string saying so.
Emitting the empty record rather than nothing keeps the invariant
``{e.tool for e in write_effects} == set(written_by)``, so a consumer that
finds no effect for a writer is looking at a bug, not at silence.
