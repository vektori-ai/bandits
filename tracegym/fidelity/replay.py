"""Replay a recorded trace against the environment rebuilt from it.

This is the measurement the whole project turns on. An environment that cannot
reproduce its own source trace is not a model of anything (PLAN.md Step 12), and
the only way to find that out is to feed the recorded actions back in, in order,
and compare what comes out.

How a replay runs
-----------------
1. Build a session for the trace's :class:`~tracegym.contracts.TaskCase` -- the
   same reconstructed pre-state an RL rollout would start from. If the pre-state
   is wrong, the replay says so, which is exactly what we want it to say.
2. Feed every :class:`~tracegym.contracts.InvocationPoint` in ``step`` order via
   ``session.execute(tool, arguments)``.
3. Compare each returned :class:`~tracegym.contracts.Observation` against the
   recorded ``response``/``status``/``error_kind``.

Three rules that are easy to get wrong
--------------------------------------
**Never stop at the first divergence.** Per-tool rates are the product. Halting
on the first bad call would report one broken tool and leave every other tool
unmeasured, which is precisely the aggregate-hides-the-problem failure the gate
exists to prevent. So a divergence is recorded and the replay continues -- and
it continues *against the environment as it now is*, divergence included, which
means a bad write shows up again in the reads that follow it. That is honest:
production did not get a fresh environment after each call either.

**Unsupported is not mismatched.** A tool that raises
:class:`~tracegym.env.UnsupportedToolError` is counted as ``unsupported`` and
reported on its own line. "We could not model this" and "we modeled it wrong"
are different facts with different fixes: the first sends you to schema
inference or to an explicit rule, the second to the tool implementation. They
are still both failures -- see :mod:`tracegym.fidelity.gate` for why unsupported
calls stay in the denominator.

**External tools are checked by effect, not by response.** ``send_email``
returned ``{"sent": true}`` in production; the stub returns whatever
acknowledgement it was configured with, and it never sent anything. Demanding
body equality would measure how well we guessed a vendor's acknowledgement
format, which is not a property of the world we rebuilt. What *is* a property of
the world we rebuilt is whether the attempt landed in the effect ledger with the
arguments it was called with -- so that is what is asserted, together with the
call status. Verifiers assert on the ledger too (``EFFECT_COUNT``), so this is
the same surface reward is computed from.
