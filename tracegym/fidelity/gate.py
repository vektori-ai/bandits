"""The accept/reject decision.

One number decides whether a rebuilt environment is allowed near training. This
module is where that number is turned into a verdict, and the verdict is
deliberately harder to pass than a single average.

The rule
--------
**Accept requires both:**

1. ``overall_rate >= threshold`` (default 0.90), and
2. **every tool that was actually replayed** is at or above ``per_tool_floor``
   (default 0.80).

Both, because either alone is unsafe. An aggregate hides a single broken tool:
in the README's example the overall rate is 93% while ``update_order_status``
sits at 38%, and an agent trained in that environment learns a status update is
a coin flip. PLAN.md Step 12 is explicit that per-tool is what gets reported --
"one tool at 40% divergence tells you exactly what to fix, an average tells you
nothing" -- so per-tool is also what gets enforced. Conversely a per-tool floor
alone would accept an environment where every tool sits at 81%, which is nine
wrong answers in fifty and no single line to point at.

``min_calls_for_floor`` exists because a floor over one observation is noise,
not evidence. It defaults to 1 (every tool is judged); raise it when a corpus
has a long tail of tools called once. Tools below it are still reported, still
counted in the overall rate, and named in ``notes`` so the exemption is visible
rather than silent.

What happens to unsupported calls
---------------------------------
**They stay in the denominator and never count as matched.** A tool the
environment refuses to reimplement is a hole in the model of the world, and the
one thing this gate must never do is get a better score by measuring less. If
unsupported calls were excluded, an environment that supports one tool perfectly
and refuses the other eight would report 100%.

They are nevertheless reported on their own column and called out in ``notes``,
because the fix is different: unsupported sends you back to schema inference or
to writing an explicit rule (PLAN.md Step 7), mismatched sends you to the tool
implementation. ``ToolFidelity.rate`` is ``matched / replayed``, so a tool that
is entirely unsupported reports 0% and trips the floor on its own.

Nothing here is a partial credit scheme. A call either reproduced the recorded
observation or it did not.
