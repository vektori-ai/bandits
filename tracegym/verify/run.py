"""Evaluate a ``Verifier`` against a final state and an effect ledger.

This is the function that turns an episode into a number. It is pure: given the
same verifier, the same final state and the same effects it returns the same
reward, forever. No sampling, no model, no clock.

**Reward rule.** Default is all-or-nothing: every assertion passes or the reward
is 0.0. Partial credit is opt-in.

Why all-or-nothing is the safe default here. tracegym's output feeds a pass@k
routing gate - "can the model already do this?" - and a partial score makes that
question unanswerable: a rollout that sets the status correctly but also wipes an
unrelated table scores 0.6, and 0.6 is neither a pass nor a failure. Worse,
partial credit is a gradient toward whichever assertion is cheapest to satisfy,
which is usually the one that needs no tool call at all (STATE_UNCHANGED passes
for free if you do nothing). Partial credit is useful for *debugging* a verifier
and for dense-reward experiments where somebody has looked at the assertion mix
and decided it is safe. It is never the default.
