"""Synthesize a ``Verifier`` by diffing pre-state against final state.

PLAN.md Step 11: reward is an assertion over the final state and the effect
ledger, never a judge. This module writes those assertions automatically, from
one trace, deterministically - no model, no network, no heuristic scoring.

The shape of the diff::

    field changed        -> STATE_EQUALS
    row appeared         -> ROW_EXISTS
    row disappeared      -> ROW_ABSENT
    external tool called -> EFFECT_COUNT
    nothing changed      -> STATE_UNCHANGED

That last line is the one people skip. If the verifier only checks that
``orders[7741].status == 'refunded'``, an agent that also empties the customers
table scores full marks. Collateral damage has to cost something or the policy
learns it is free. So every entity and every row we have pre-state evidence for,
and which the trace did not change, gets an explicit STATE_UNCHANGED.

Two refusals are deliberate:

* **Only positively-labeled traces.** "Do what production did" is not a reward
  function unless production was labeled correct. Synthesizing from an
  unlabeled or failed trace bakes the failure in as the target.
* **``reviewed_by`` starts None.** A generated reward function nobody has read
  is an unexamined reward function. :func:`tracegym.verify.run.evaluate` refuses
  to grade with one unless the caller explicitly opts out for testing.
