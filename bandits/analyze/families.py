"""Group episodes into task families and select a defensible set from them.

The goal is not to find every task. It is to choose a small set that stands for a
large share of real production volume, and to say plainly how much it leaves out.

Two rules shape everything here. Grouping reads only ``at_start`` content, so a
family can never be defined by something a live request would not know. And the
fit/held-out split moves whole lineage groups, never individual traces, so a
retry of the same request cannot land on both sides of the boundary.
